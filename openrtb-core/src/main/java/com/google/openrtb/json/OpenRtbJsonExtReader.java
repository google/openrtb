/**
 * A desserialization extension, can consume children of "ext" fields.
 * This base class is good for extensions stored directly in the parent Message;
 * for wrapper extensions use the subclass {@link OpenRtbJsonExtComplexReader}.
 * Both allow very flexible mapping from JSON fields into the model extension messages.
 * Consider an example with "imp": { ..., "ext": { p1: 1, p2: 2, p3: 3 } }, and three
 * extension readers where ER1 reads {p4}, ER2 reads {p2}, ER3 reads {p1,p3}.
 * The main {@link OpenRtbJsonReader} will start at p1, invoking all compatible
 * {@link OpenRtbJsonExtReader}s until some of them consumes that property.
 * We also need to consider some complications:
 *
 * <p><ol>
 * <li>ER3 will read p1, but then comes p2 which ER3 doesn't recognize. We need to store
 *    what we have been able to read, then return false, so the main reader knows that
 *    it needs to reset the loop and try all ExtReaders again (ER2 will read p2).</li>
 * <li>ER2 won't recognize p3, so the same thing happens: return false, main reader
 *    tries all ExtReader's, ER3 will handle p3.  This will be the second invocation
 *    to ER3 for the same "ext" object, that's why we need the ternary conditional
 *    below to reuse the {@code MyExt.Imp.Builder} if that was already set previously.</li>
 * <li>ER1 will be invoked several times, but never find any property it recognizes.
 *    It shouldn'set set an extension object that will be always empty.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface have to be threadsafe.
