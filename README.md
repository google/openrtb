BUILDING NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You need: JDK 7, Maven 3.2, Protocol buffers (protoc) 2.6.1.
Building is supported from the command line with Maven and
from any IDE that can load Maven projects.

On Eclipse, the latest m2e is recommended but it can't run the code
generation step, so you need to run a "mvn install" from the command
line after checkout or after any mvn clean.
